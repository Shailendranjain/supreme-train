<h3>But before that, lets learn something about ORIGAMI</h3>
        </div>


        <div class="three">
<p><i><h2>Importance Of Origami</h2></i></p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Helps in thinking Skills: </h4></li>
<h5>Origami excites other modalities of learning. It has been shown to improve spatial visualization skills using hands-on learning. Such skills allow children to comprehend, characterize, and construct their own vernacular for the world around them.</h5>

<li><h4>Makes Problem Solving Easier: </h4></li>
<h5>Often in assignments, there is one set answer and one way to get there. Origami provides children an opportunity to solve something that isn't prescribed and gives them a chance to make friends with failure</h5>

<li><h4>Improvement in Geometry: </h4></li>
<h5>According to the National Center for Education Statistics in 2003, geometry was one area of weakness among American students. Origami has been found to strengthen an understanding of geometric concepts, formulas, and labels, making them come alive.</h5>
</ul>
<br>
<p><i><h2>Origin of Origami</h2></i></p>
<h5>Writing a comprehensive history of paper folding is almost impossible, since information about the art form prior to the 15th century is virtually nonexistent. There are many plausible assertions about its origins and early history, but most of those are based on little firm documentation. Many studies assert that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in China. It is also highly probable that the process of folding was applied to other materials before paper was invented, so the origins of recreational folding may lie with cloth or leather. Certainly, within Europe, the practise of napkin folding and cloth pleating were held in high esteem. However, paper has proved to be the ideal material to fold, and so it is logical to assume that paper folding followed the discovery of the papermaking process.</h5>
